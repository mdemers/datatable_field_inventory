##Datatable for FL_islandora MODS/Solr Field Inventory

This jawn takes a big'ol spreadsheet from google sheets filled with solr fields constructed from MODS elements in fedora repo datastreams with columns designating related fields+labels throughout islandora and points a jquery datatable at it. Now instead of having either a database or a single spreadsheet you have a searchable/sortable/exportable table with bright pretty buttons.

Credit for the hard part goes to [other people](https://github.com/scottpham/tabletop-to-datatables).
